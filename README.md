# EscapeFromTheWoods
Test Assignment

### The escape from the woods

There is no sweeter person than a grandmother. The autumn came, and you, as her favorite grandchild, are the one who can help her to prepare for the winter. How? She wants to have some mushrooms picked and dried for the most delicious and warm dinner. And, of course, you said yes.
You go to the forest and see that mushrooms are growing like crazy, and you can bring it all back home to your grandma's house.
The hours passed while you were so busy that you had not noticed how the sunset started to set. When you realized the darkness was coming, it was already too late to take the same route you came here. The only solution is to find a new road in the forest, which would be the fastest way out. Luckily, grandma gave you the old map of the woods in case you got lost.
One thought that keeps you calm is that you are a DEVELOPER. There must be a solution that you can write to find the fastest way out! Grandma is waiting. Act now!


## Assignment

Read the map file from the resources folder and count the least number of steps needed to get out of the forest.

## Game rules

• Find the fastest way out from the forest and return steps count as an answer (output)

• At the starting position (at the symbol “X”), your steps count is 0

• You can only move through the empty spaces (symbol “ ”)

• If the file is corrupted or there is no exit – return 0

## Map Characteristics

• The map is a rectangular shape

• Axis size: 5 <= X <= 11000, 5 <= Y <= 11000
• Map consists of symbols “ ”, “1”, “X”

 “ ” – empty spaces where you can move

 “1” – forest/trees
 
“X” – your start position

• There could be from 0 to 1000 exits
To achieve better results, you have several map files that you can test.

## Other Requirements

• Keep the code clean and use the best coding practices

• Write unit tests for the solution

• The submitted solution should not be printing anything to the console

• You cannot make any changes in the Game.java file
